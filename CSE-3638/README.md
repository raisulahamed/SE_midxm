A Library Management System (LMS) is a software tool that helps libraries run smoothly. It keeps track of books, journals, and other materials. With an LMS, libraries can organize their collections, manage borrowing and returning of items, and keep records of who borrowed what. It also helps find books quickly, check for overdue items, manage stock, create reports, and automate everyday tasks to save time and improve service.
